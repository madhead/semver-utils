## Ready to make a change?

Fork the repo.

### Fork using GitHub Desktop

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

### Fork using the command line

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

## Make your update

Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.

Touching the code?
Make sure to add some tests demonstrating the use cases or solved issues.
Don't forget to bump the version in the `package.json`, use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Open a pull request

You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a README.
You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Issue labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

- The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/madhead/semver-utils/labels/help%20wanted) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/madhead/semver-utils/labels/good%20first%20issue) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- The [`ci` label](https://github.com/madhead/semver-utils/labels/CI%2FCD) is for problems or updates in the testing, releasing & publishing process.
